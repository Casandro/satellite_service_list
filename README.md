# satellite_service_list
A list of satellite services regularly updated by an automated script.


This list will be updated every hour from a decently sized tvheadend instance. Feel free to use this database for whatever you want. If you have access to other satellite positions or better receptions of those. Feel free to contact me.

If you find new transponders not in this list, feel free to request them as a github issue.
